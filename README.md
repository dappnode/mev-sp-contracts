# mev-sp-contracts

The dappnode **mev smoothing pool** is made of three repositories:

- [mev-sp-contracts](https://github.com/dappnode/mev-sp-contracts): contains the smoothing pool contracts where validators must send their rewards to, used to subscribe/unsubscribe and claim their share.
- [mev-sp-oracle](https://github.com/dappnode/mev-sp-oracle): contains the rewards calculation algorithm and utilities to both update the merkle root of the tree and create proofs to be used in the smart contract for claiming rewards.
- [mev-sp-trees](https://github.com/dappnode/mev-sp-trees): contains all rewards calculations for all subscribed validators organised per checkpoint, with all the merkle proofs and each checkpoint's merkle root.
